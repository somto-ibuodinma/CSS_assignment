                <p style="text-align: justify;">Renewable energies, environmentally friendly and inexhaustible, are the mainstay of the effort to achieve the objectives set out in the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular those relating to the fight against climate change and universal access to energy. Hybrid generation plants, which use two renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic and wind, to ensure a more stable supply, are proving to be fundamental in achieving these aims.

                </p><h3 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(125, 30, 225);" >WHAT IS HYBRID ELECTRICAL POWER</h3></p>
                   <p style= "text-align: justify;"> Hybrid power systems are those that generate electricity 
                       from two or more sources, usually renewable, sharing a single 
                       connexion point. Although the addition of powers of hybrid generation 
                       modules are higher than evacuation capacity, inverted energy never can 
                       exceed this limit. In that way, a hybrid generation plant can, therefore,
                        use, for example, photovoltaic energy when the sun shines and another 
                        source, such as wind, in cloudy weather, thus ensuring a more stable and
                         efficient supply. Hybrid installation may or may not always include storage 
                         systems.</p>
